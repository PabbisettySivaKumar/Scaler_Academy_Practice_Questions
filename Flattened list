Problem Description:

Given a nested list that consists of different length sublists, write a program to return the elements in a flattened list from the given nested list.

Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of test cases. For each testcase the inputs will be taken as following:
First line consists of an integer n representing the number of sublists in the nested list.
The next n lines consists of space separated strings representing the elements of sublists.
Output Format:

The flattened list consisting of all the string elements of the nested list.
Sample Input:

1
3
Scaler is Awesome
Python for Data Science
Machine Learning
Sample Output:

['Scaler','is','Awesome','Python','for','Data','Science','Machine','Learning']


Solution:


def flatten(lst):
    ''' input:lst-nested list of sublists of strings
         output:return the flattened list of strings'''

    flatten_list = []
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    
    for i in lst:
        for j in i:
            flatten_list.append(j)

    return flatten_list
