Problem Description:

You have a dataset with n inputs. Each input contains 3 variables (x, z, w). You want to divide these inputs into 3 categories (A, B, and C).    
This is decided on the basis of following process:

Step1: Calculate y = 2 + 3*x + z**3 + (w mod 2)

Step2:

If y > 10: input belongs to class A

If 0 < y <= 10 : input belongs to class B

If y<=0: Input belongs to class C

Your task is to find out the number of points belonging to each category and return the number of points in A,B and C
Input Format:

First, take n as input, and then the n inputs all in separate lines.
Output Format:

Print the no. of points in class A then B then C each separated by a space in a single line.
Input:

2

3 1 4

-5 1 1
Output:

1 0 1

solution:

def calc_class(x, z, w):
    a = 0
    b = 0
    c = 0
    
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    
    y = 2 + 3*x + z**3 + w%2
    
    if y>10:
        a =a+1
    elif y >0 and y<=10:
        b = b+1
    else:
        c= c+1
    
    return a,b,c
