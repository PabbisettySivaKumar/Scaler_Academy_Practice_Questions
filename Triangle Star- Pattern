 Triangle Star- Pattern


Problem Description:

Write a function to print the pattern shown in the sample using n given as a parameter, where n defines the number of rows.

Note: There isn't any space between consecutive stars.

Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of the test cases. For each testcase there will be only one line of input:
The one line contains the n in integer format.
Output Format:

Triangle Star Pattern in string format for each testcase.


Sample Input:

1  
5
Sample Output:

    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********


Sample Explanation:

The first row prints n-1 i.e. 
4 spaces at the start and then 1 star. 
The second row first prints (n-2=3) spaces and then 3 stars. 
This updating of stars by 2 and spaces by -1 keeps happening until the last row where the space becomes zero.

Solution:

def star_pattern(n):
    '''input: n = An Integer value defines number of rows
       output: print triangle star pattern'''
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n-(i+1)):
            print(end=' ')
        print('*'*(i+(i+1)),end='')
        print()
