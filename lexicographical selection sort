lexicographical selection sort


Given a list of strings, use selection sort to sort these strings in lexicographical order.

Input Format:

space-separated strings 
Output Format:

list of strings 
Sample Input:

['alpha', 'gamma', 'beta', 'delta'] 
Sample Output:

['alpha', 'beta', 'delta', 'gamma']
Sample explanation:

alpha is lexicographically smallest as it starts with 'a' and gamma is lexicographically largest as its initial character is 'g'.


Solution:


def selectionSort(lis):
    for i in range(len(lis)):
        min_index = i
        min_str = lis[i]
        for j in range(i+1,len(lis)):
            if min_str>lis[j]:
                min_str = lis[j]
                min_index = j
        temp = lis[i]
        lis[i] = lis[min_index]
        lis[min_index] = temp
    return lis
