Problem Description:
You have been given 3 sides of a triangle. Write a program to find whether it is an isosceles, equilateral, or Right-angled triangle. There will not be more than 1 answer. Print “E” for Equilateral, “I” for isosceles, “R” for right-angled, and “O” otherwise.


Input Format:

First line has the number of test cases. For each testcase there will be three lines of inputs in float format representing the 3 sides of triangle.


Output Format:

Type of triangle in a single character in string format


Sample Input:

1
3
4
5


Sample Output:

R

Solution:


def triangle(a,b,c):
   
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    if (a*a) + (b*b) == (c*c) or (b*b) + (c*c) == (a*a) or (a*a) + (c*c) == (b*b):
        print('R')
    elif (a==b) and (b==c):
        print('E')
    elif (a==b) or (b==c) or (c==a):
        print('I')
    else:
        print('O')
