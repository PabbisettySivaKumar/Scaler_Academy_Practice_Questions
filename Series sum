Series sum


Problem Description:

Write a program to calculate the sum of the positive integers of the series n + (n-2) + (n-4)..... (until n-x â‰¥ 0).

Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of test cases. For each test case there will be one line of input as explained following:
The one line contains n in integer format.
Output Format:

Series sum in integer format should be returned.
Sample Input:

1
10
Sample Output:

30
Sample Explanation:

As 10 + (10-2) + (10-4) + (10-6) + (10-8) + (10-10) = 10 + 8 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30, 30 is returned as the series sum for n=10.


Solution:


def sum_series(n):
    '''n = Input in integer format
       output:return sum of the series'''
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    
    if n%2==0:
        if n<2:
            return 0
        else:
            return n+sum_series(n-2)
    else:
        if n<=1:
            return 1
        else:
            return n+sum_series(n-2)

    return None
