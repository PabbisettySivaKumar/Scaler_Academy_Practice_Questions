Given a nested list that consists of different types of courses. Write a program using list comprehension that returns the courses names that have lengths of less than 5 in a flattened list.

Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of test cases. For each testcase the input is taken as following:
The first line consist of n (integer) representing the number of rows/sublists.
The next n lines consist of same number of space separated strings representing the elements in the rows.
Output Format:

The list that consists of courses with length less than 5.
Sample Input:

1
python NLP DL
Statistics Tableau ML
AI Analytics SQL BigData'
Sample Output:

['NLP', 'DL', 'ML', 'AI', 'SQL']


Solution:


def course_5(courses):
    ''' input:courses-nested list
         output:return the flattened list of courses where length of each course name should be less than 5'''
    
    course=[]
    #print(courses)
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    for i in courses:
        for j in i:
            if len(j)<5:
                course.append(j)
    
    return course
