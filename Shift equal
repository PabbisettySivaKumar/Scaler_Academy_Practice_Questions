Problem Description:

Complete the function check_equal() to return whether the given two strings are the same or not if you are allowed to:

Shift the first character of the second string, and
Attach it to the end of the rightmost character of the second string itself,
and this can be repeated as many times as required.
The function should return 'Same' if the two strings using the above-mentioned shifting operations are the same; otherwise, it should return 'Not Same'.

Sample input:

abcde
bcdea
Sample output:

Same
Sample explanation:

On shifting b, c, d, and e to the end of the 2nd string, we get abcde as the output, which is the same as the first string. Hence, Same is returned.


Solution:


def check_equal(str1, str2):
    '''
    input:
    str1 -> the first input string
    str2 -> the second input string
    output:
    res -> "Same" if both strings are same, or "Not Same"
    '''
    res = ""
    
    # Your code starts here
    str3 = str2[-1] + str2[:len(str2)-1]
    str4 = str1[-1] + str1[:len(str1)-1]
    #print(str3)

    if str1 == str3 or str2 == str4:
        res = 'Same'
    else:
        res = 'Not Same'
    
    
    # Your code ends here
    return res
