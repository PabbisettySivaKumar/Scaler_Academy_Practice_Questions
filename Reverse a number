Reverse a number


Problem Description:

Write a recursive function to return the reverse of a given number passed as an argument.

Input Format:

The function will have two arguments.
The first argument is the number n that is to be reversed.
The second argument is a string temp which is empty by default.
Output Format:

Return the number in reverse order in the string format.
Sample Input:

123
100
Sample Output:

321
001
Note: Trailing zeroes in the original number should be included in the front of reversed answer.


Solution:


def rev(n, temp=''):
    ''' n-indicates the number to be reversed,
         output:Return the number in reversed order in the string format'''
    
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE

    if n==0:
        return temp
    lst = n%10
    n=n//10
    temp += str(lst)
    return rev(n,temp)
