first and last element


Problem Description
Given an unsorted list of n integers, return the sum of the first and last elements after implementing bubble sort on the first k elements to arrange them in increasing order.

Input Format

Space separated values for Integers, arr


Output Format

The required sum


Example Input

64 34 25 12 22 11 90


Example Output

102


Example Explanation
The list after implementing bubble sort on first 4 elements, becomes [12, 25, 34, 64, 22, 11, 90].
So the sum of the first and last element becomes 12+90 = 102.


Solution:


def bubbleSort(arr,k):
    """
    argument arr is list, k is int
    store result in res
    """
    
    res=0
    #YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    for i in range(k):
        for j in range(i+1,k):
            if arr[i] >arr[j]:
                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j],arr[i]
    res = arr[0] + arr[-1]

    
    return res
