Problem Description:

Write a function to print a similar pattern as shown in the sample using n, where n defines the number of rows.

Note: There isn't any space between stars in the first row.

Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of the test cases. For each testcase there will be one line of input:
The one line contains n in integer format.
Output Format:

Print Star Pattern in string format for each testcase.
Sample Input:

1
8
Sample Output:

********
*     *
*    *

Sample Explanation:

In the first row, (n=8) stars are printed. In the second row, 2 stars are printed with 5 spaces between them. 
This number of spaces keeps decreasing by 1 after the second row until the last row where the number of spaces becomes zero and only one star is printed.

solution:

def star(n):
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        for j in range(i,n+1):
            if i==j or i==1 or j==n:
                print('*',end='')
            else:
                print(' ',end='')
        print()
