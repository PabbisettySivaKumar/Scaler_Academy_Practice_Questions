Transpose of matrix


Problem Description:

Write a program to print the rows/sublists of the transpose of the given matrix/nested list.

Note: The transpose of a matrix is obtained by interchanging its rows into columns or columns into rows. (AT or A')

Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of test cases. For each testcase the input is taken as following:
The first line consist of n (integer) representing the number of rows.
The next n lines consist of same number of space separated integers representing the elements in the rows.
Output Format:

Rows of transpose of the given nested list/ matrix are printed in new lines.
Sample Input:

1
4
1 2
3 8
4 7
5 6
Sample Output:

[1, 3, 4, 5]
[2, 8, 7, 6]
Sample explanation:

The transposed matrix is [[1, 3, 4, 5] [2, 8, 7, 6]], and the two rows/sublists are printed in new lines.


Solution;


def transpose(m):
    result = list([0 for i in range(len(m))] for j in range(len(m[0])))
    for i in range(len(m)):
        for j in range(len(m[0])):
            result[j][i] = m[i][j]
    for k in result:
        print(k)
