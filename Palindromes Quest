Palindromes Quest


Problem Description:

Write a program to find out the total number of palindromic integers within the given range [l, r] inclusive of both l and r.

Input Format:

l and r are given in the format of space separated integers
Output Format:

The total number of palindromic intgers in integer format is printed in range l and r
Sample Input:

0 15
Sample Output:

11
Sample explanation:

The palindromes between 0 and 15 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4....9, 11 which are 11 in total number.


Solution:


l, r = map(int, input().split(" "))
#l and r represents the upper and lower boundary for the range
#print the total number of palindromic integers

ans = 0

#YOUR CODE GOES HERE

for i in range(l,r):
    i = str(i)
    if i == i[::-1]:
        ans = ans+1
print(ans)
