Percentage and Grade


Problem Description:

Write a program to calculate the percentage (according to marks of a student) and grade (according to the percentage of a student). Five numbers(A, B, C, D & E) represent the marks of a student in 5 subjects which are out of 100. Print the percentage and the grade of the student.

If percentage >= 90% : Grade A
If percentage >= 80% but <90 : Grade B
If percentage >= 70% but <80: Grade C
If percentage >= 60% but <70: Grade D
If percentage >= 40% but <60: Grade E
If percentage < 40%: Grade F
NOTE: You have to take the lowest integer of the percentage. E.g. 90.8% will be treated as 90%.

Input Format:

There will be five lines of inputs as following:

The five lines contain the 5 subject marks of the student in numerical format.
Output Format:

The first line indicates the percentage in integer format.  

The next line displays the grade in string format.
Sample Input:

50   
60   
70   
80   
90
Sample Output:

70   
C  


Solution:


def main():
    m1 = int(input())
    m2 = int(input())
    m3 = int(input())
    m4 = int(input())
    m5 = int(input())
    # m1,m2,m3,m4,m5 = marks of the five subjects
    # Output: Print percentage and the grade
    total = m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5
    per = int(total/5)
    print(per)
    if(per >= 90): 
        print("A")
    elif(per >= 80): 
        print("B")
    elif(per >= 70): 
        print("C")
    elif(per >= 60): 
        print("D")
    elif(per >= 40): 
        print("E")
    else : 
        print("F")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
