For a given number A, print its multiplication table having the first 10 multiples.

Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of the test cases t.
The next t lines contain a single integer A for each testcase.
Output Format:

10 lines for each testcase, an ith line containing ith multiple.
Sample Input:

1
2
Sample Output:

 2 * 1 = 2 
 2 * 2 = 4 
 2 * 3 = 6 
 2 * 4 = 8 
 2 * 5 = 10 
 2 * 6 = 12 
 2 * 7 = 14 
 2 * 8 = 16 
 2 * 9 = 18 
 2 * 10 = 20 


Solution:


def multiple_table(a):
    '''input: a = integer which multiplication table need to be printed
       output: a multiplication table of length 10 is expected to be printed.'''
