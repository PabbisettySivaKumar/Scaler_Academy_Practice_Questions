Problem Description:

Write a program to find the frequency of digit 1 in a given integer A.

Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of the test cases
For each testcase a line contains an integer A.
Output Format:

The frequency of digit 1 in integer format in a new line for each testcase.

Sample Input:

1
121234
Sample Output:

2
Sample Explanation:

As the number 121234 has 1 at 1st and 3rd position therefore answer is 2.

Solution:

def frequency(n):
    count=0
    '''input: n = A single integer
       output: Frequency of 1 in n is to be returned by storing the frequency in count variable'''
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE

    while n!=0:
        rem = n%10
        if rem ==1:
            count = count+1
        n = n//10

    return count
