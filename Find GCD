Find GCD


Problem Description:

Write a program to find the Greatest common divisor of given 2 numbers.

Input Format:

There will be one line of input that consists  of two space separated numbers in integer format.
Output Format:

Print the greatest coomon divisor in integer format.
Sample Input:

2 4
Sample Output:

2
Sample explanation:

The highest common divisor of 2 and 4 is 2.

Solution:


a, b = map(int, input().split(" "))
#a and b will simply be two integers use them for the calculation.

#YOUR CODE GOES HERE

if a>b:
    temp =b
else:
    temp =a
    for i in range(1, temp+1):
        if a%i ==0 and b%i ==0:
            gcd = i 
print(gcd)
