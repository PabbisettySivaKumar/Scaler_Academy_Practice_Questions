Occurrence of "hi"


Problem Description:

Write a recursive function that returns the number of occurrences of "hi" in the string passed as a parameter to the function.

Input Format:

The function has two arguments count which is 0 by default and represents the count of "hi" in s.
The second argument to this function is s.
Output Format:

Return the count of 'hi' occurrences in the string in integer format for each testcase.
Sample Input:

'hishisha'
Sample Output:

2
Sample explanation:

'hi' occurs at index [0,1] and [3,4] in the string 'hishisha' therefore 2 is returned.


Solution:


def countHi(s, count=0):
    ''' s-indicates the string,
         output:Return the count of occurrences of "hi" in s'''
    
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE
    len_s = len(s)
    len_substr = len('hi')

    if len_s == 0:
        return count
   
    if len_s < len_substr:
        return count

    if 'hi' == s[0:len_substr]:
        count += 1
   
    count = countHi(s[1:],count)

    return count
