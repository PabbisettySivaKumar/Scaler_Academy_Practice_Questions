Harmonic sum


Problem Description:

Write a recursive program to calculate the harmonic sum of the first n numbers.

Note: The harmonic sum is the sum of reciprocals of the positive integers. (Round the sum to 3 decimal places)


1+1/2+1/3+1/4+.....


Input Format:

The first line indicates the number of the test cases. For each testcase there will be one line of input as explained following:
The one line inputs contains n in integer format.
Output Format:

Harmonic Sum in float format is returned.
Sample Input:

1
7
Sample Output:

2.593


Solution:


def harmonic_sum(n):
    '''n = Input in integer format
       output:return harmonic sum'''
    # YOUR CODE GOES HERE

    if n<2:
        return 1
    else:
        return round(1/n+harmonic_sum(n-1),3)
